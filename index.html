<h2>Hello!</h2>

<p>My name is Kayla Engle and I am a student at the University of Minnesota. I will be graduating this December with a degree in Technical Writing and Communication, and Political Science. When I am not studying for class, I enjoy reading, cooking, going to concerts, and spending time with family. </p>


<h2>Education</h2>

<p> I have a double major in Technical Writing & Communication and Political Science. This semester I am taking 16 credits, one of which is my senior project. After I graduate I will receive a Bachelor of Science.</p>


<h2>Interests</h2>

<p>Within my major my interests are public policy and climate change. Personally, once I have more free time, I hope to expand my interests in cooking, beer making, yoga, and reading.</p>
